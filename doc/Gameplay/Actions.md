## Vote
During Day, publicly cast a vote for another player, or abstain. If a majority of living players vote for another player, or enough players to prevent a majority vote to abstain, an Election occurs and the game moves to Night.
During Dusk, the avenger (The IDIOT who was elected) can Vote for an elector that elected the avenger. This player is eliminated, then the avenger is eliminated.
## Reveal
During Day, the revealer's [[Roles|Role]] is revealed authoritatively.
## Target
Targeting is done by an individual player and involves selecting another player. Usually done during Night/
### Investigate
During Night, Target another player. Upon Dawn, as long as the target and investigator are not killed, the investigator learns information about the target's role. Depending on game rules, they can learn:
- The [[Roles|Role]] of the target
- The [[Teams|Team Alignment]] of the target
- Whether the target is [[Teams#Mafia|Mafia Aligned]] or is not Mafia Aligned ("Guilty" or "Innocent")
### Save
During Night, Target another player. If the target was targeted by a [[Teams#Mafia|Mafia]] [[#Scheme]], they will not be killed.
### Scheme
During Night, a [[Teams#Mafia|Mafia Aligned]] player, the "Killer", can assign a "Mark". Upon Dawn, the Mark will be Eliminated.
### Strip
During Night, Target another player. Blocks that player's ability. The effect depends on the [[Roles|Role]] blocked:
- [[Roles#COP|COP]]: If the COP investigates, that investigation is blocked and the COP learns they were blocked
- [[Roles#DOCTOR|DOCTOR]]: If the DOCTOR's target is marked by a Scheme, the Save action is blocked and the Doctor learns they were blocked
- [[Roles#CELEB|CELEB]]: The CELEB remains blocked during the following Day. If the CELEB tries to [[Actions#Reveal|Reveal]], the action is blocked and the CELEB learns they were blocked
As a general principle, a stripped player does not learn they were stripped unless the strip has a noticeable effect. At this point, the fact they were blocked is obvious, and so they are notified.
