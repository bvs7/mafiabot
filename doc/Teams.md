#### Description
Each [[Roles|Role]] is part of a **Team**. The basic teams in every game are Town and Mafia. These Teams compete for victory.

## Town
The Town team is given no extra information. Their win condition is eliminating all players on the Mafia Team. Town Team members will usually make up the majority of players.

## Mafia
The Mafia Team is told who their teammates, the other Mafia Team members, are. Their win condition is being at least half of the voting power in the game. (In a basic game, this is the point at which it is impossible for Town to win because a vote for a Mafia member would never pass, assuming Mafia don't vote for them).

## Rogue
The Rogue Team is not cooperating. Each Rogue Team member has their own personal win condition.
